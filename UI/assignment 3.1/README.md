# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the PyTorch library. The network is trained using three optimization algorithms: **SGD**, **SGD with momentum**, and **ADAM**. The results of these methods are compared and visualized.

## Features

- Feedforward neural network architecture
- Training with three optimization algorithms: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), SGD with Momentum, ADAM
- Visualization of the results for easy comparison
