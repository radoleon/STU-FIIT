## Neural Network for Solving XOR, OR, and AND Problems

This project implements a modular neural network for solving logical problems such as XOR, OR, and AND using backpropagation. The network allows for testing various hyperparameters and architectures while visualizing the training results to determine the best-performing models.

## Features
  - Linear layers with modular forward and backward propagation.
  - Activation functions: ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid.
  - Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  - Configurable Hyperparameters: learning rate, weight initialization, momentum, and biases.
