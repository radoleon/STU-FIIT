# NBA Dataset Queries

### Description  
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based system designed to track and analyze basketball game events, player statistics, and team data. It enables querying complex game scenarios and extracting detailed insights about NBA matches and participants.

### Features  
- Single SQL queries solve each task without lateral joins or recursion  
- Structured outputs with precise column order and naming  
- Rounding of decimal values to two decimal places where applicable  
- Parameterized queries using placeholders like `{{parameter_name}}`  
- Efficient query execution suitable for large datasets  
- Use of Common Table Expressions (CTE) to organize complex queries  

### Setup  
To work with this project, you need a PostgreSQL database environment with the NBA schema loaded. Ensure your SQL client supports standard SQL syntax and CTEs.
