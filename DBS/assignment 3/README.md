# RPG System Data Modeling

### Description  
This assignment involves the implementation of a physical data model for a turn-based RPG combat system using PostgreSQL. Building upon a previously designed logical model, the project covers schema creation, indexing, stored procedures, views, sample data, and acceptance tests to simulate and analyze tactical RPG combat scenarios.

### Features  
- Complete physical schema implementation including tables, keys, and constraints  
- Indexing strategy to optimize combat and damage query performance  
- Stored procedures encapsulating core combat mechanics such as spellcasting, attacking, resting, entering combat, and looting  
- Functions to support game logic calculations (e.g., effective spell cost)  
- Views providing summaries on combat state, damage statistics, and character rankings  
- Sample data and acceptance tests to validate the correctness of implemented processes  

### Setup  
Requires a PostgreSQL environment. Execute provided SQL scripts to create the schema, indexes, stored procedures, functions, views, and to load sample data for testing and validation.
