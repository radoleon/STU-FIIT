## Project 2 - Linked Lists
This program works with the records stored in the text file `dataloger_V2.txt`, which are at the start of the program loaded into a linked list. Each record is represented as a structure data type with these properties ***ID, position, type, value, time, date***.

The program is intended to perform various commands loaded from the standart input.
- `n` command to load records from the text file into a linked list
- `v` command to print out the whole linked list into the console
- `p` command to add a record into the linked list at a specified position
- `z` command to remove records from the linked list based on the provided ID
- `u` command to sort the records from newest to oldest
- `r` command to switch the position of two records in the linked list
- `k` command to free the allocated memory and end the program
